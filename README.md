      <b>Betrayal in The City</b> was first published in 1976 and in 1977, was Kenya's national entry to the second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture in Lagos, Nigeria.
      The play is an incisive, thought-provoking examination of the problems of independence and freedom in post-colonial African states, 
      where a sizeable number of people feel that their future is bleak. In the words of Mosese, one of the characters, 
      "<q>It was better while we waited. Now we have nothing to look forward to. We have killed our past and are busy killing our future.</q>"
